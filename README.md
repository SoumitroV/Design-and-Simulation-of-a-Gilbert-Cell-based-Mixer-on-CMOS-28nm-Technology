## Introduction

Mixers find wide use in communication applications expecially in up and down converter analog font ends. New applications such as Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) require low-power, low-cost single chip designs. This repository presents the design and simulation of Gilbert cell based mixer on CMOS 28nm technology. The design has been created on Synopsis [Custom Compiler](https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/custom-design-platform/custom-compiler.html) software and simulated using [PrimeWave](https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/ams-simulation/primewave.html) environment.
