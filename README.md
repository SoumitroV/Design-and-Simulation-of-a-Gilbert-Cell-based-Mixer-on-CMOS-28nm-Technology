## Introduction

Mixers find wide use in communication applications expecially in up and down converter analog font ends. New applications such as Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) require low-power, low-cost single chip designs. This repository presents the design and simulation of Gilbert cell based mixer on CMOS 28nm technology. The design has been created on Synopsis [Custom Compiler](https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/custom-design-platform/custom-compiler.html) software and simulated using [PrimeWave](https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/ams-simulation/primewave.html) environment.

Fig 1. shows the mixer schematic, consisting of a folded Gilbert cell. Here the local oscillator's (LO) differential input is fed to M1-M2 and M3-M4 pairs which act as transconductance amplifiers. The output current of both amplifiers is summed with opposite polarity and passed through load resistors R_L to produce the differential output voltage. The transconductance of both amplifiers can be varied by varying the currents I_1 and I_2. This is achieved with current mirror formed using FETâ€™s M7-M9 and M8-M10 controlled using the differential pair (M5-M6). The Radio Frequency (RF) signal is applied to this differential pair M5-M6, hence modulating the gain for the LO signal. The use of current mirror results in larger output voltage swing and ease of biasing.
